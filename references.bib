Abstract  (199/200 words)
Conferences are a vital aspect of many academic careers ; however, accessibility is often not at the forefront of conference planning or presentation design . We surveyed 493  potential conference attendees, including those from D/deaf, neurodivergent, and disabled communities to gather feedback on popularized changes to poster and oral presentation formats, accessibility at conferences, and measures for improving equity. Over  half of respondents reported ≥1 more accessibility need . The most commonly  (>20%) reported were processing, sensory, hearing, visual, and mobility accessibility needs. Of those with reported accessibility needs, 17.7%  indicated their needs were not met. Many (86.6%) used compensatory strategies/tools to manage their needs ; the most common was virtual access . Respondents found posters with less text and larger figures to be more accessible than traditional posters.  Conversely, oral presentation  formats that rely heavily on auditory information with little to no supporting text or relevant visuals were rated as less accessible than traditional-style oral presentations. The most common suggestion for improving oral presentations was asynchronous online access  to slides. Common themes  to improve accessibility at conferences among write-in responses included reducing crowding in poster halls, providing quiet spaces and more seating; online access and hybrid options; closed-captions; improvements for those with mobility/pain issues; and better screens, acoustics, and microphones.

Introduction 
Oral and poster presentations are a major component of academic conferences and a fundamental aspect to many academic careers  1,2. Globally, academic events are also estimated to generate more than 25 billion US in economic activity per year 3. While conferences offer opportunities to share one's work, support networking and collaboration, and provide education and access to cutting edge information 4,5, it has been noted frequently that conference talks and posters  are not only ineffective at disseminating information, but functionally and aesthetically hinder it6-9 2,10-12. 
Conference event spaces have also been criticized for having too little space between posters or for being inaccessible to disabled attendees and presenters 9,13-15. Crowded poster halls are difficult to navigate for many neurodivergent people and disabled  attendees13,15-18, and may require people to stand for a long time, which further reduces accessibility  19. 
Efforts are underway to improve the format of presentations and posters at academic and medical conferences to increase learning efficiency 12,20-23. For example, some recommend using only images in slides (or no slides) in oral presentations and reducing text on posters 24-27. While these options may offer some benefits 20,28, there remains concern that these newer presentation styles may not be fully accessible 15,29,30. 
Globally, about 15% of people are disabled 31 and 15–20% of people are neurodivergent 32. Notably, there are already established recommendations for improving accessibility in presentations  33-35 and conference spaces 30 for disabled and/or neurodivergent individuals, but they are often not adhered to. For example, even though up to 8% of men and 0.5% of women may be colorblind36 , colorblind individuals continue to report that many presentations and documents are unusable 37.                                                                        
To the best of the authors knowledge, we report here the results of the largest survey of academic and medical professionals’ accessibility needs and conference experiences. Respondents were queried regarding the potential impact of different formats on the accessibility of conference presentations  and their recommendations for improving presentations and conference spaces. We also examined published conference presentation guidelines  to determine if presenters were given guidelines about designing presentations to be accessible. 
Results 
Survey population
In total, 493  people responded to the survey and 73% completed every question. Among all survey respondents, over half (57.0%)  reported having ≥1 accessibility need and 30.6% reported having ≥2 co-occurring needs (Fig. 1 a, b). Of the 281  respondents with reported accessibility needs, the most commonly reported were processing  (44.1%) and sensory (39.5%) needs, suggesting a large portion of respondents were neurodivergent. Other reported accessibility needs included hearing (28.8%), visual (27.1%), mobility (21.4%) needs, non-native speaker (18.2%), other (13.2%), and verbal (7.1%) (Fig. 1a). The most common (≥10%) co-occurring  reported accessibility needs were processing plus sensory (26.7%), hearing plus processing (13.5%), hearing plus sensory (11.7%), processing and visual (11.4%), and visual plus hearing (10.0%; Supplemental Table 2). Almost all (>90%)  of respondents had earned a university degree (Fig. 1c) and most (84.6%)  were between the ages of 20 and 50 years old. Of all respondents (N=493), the  most commonly (≥10%) reported occupation of respondents was academic researcher (41.4%), followed by graduate student (20.3%; Fig. 1d). 
Almost three-quarters (73.8% ) of total respondents indicated they attend 1–2 in-person conferences per year. However, there is a significant relationship between reported accessibility needs status (with or without reported accessibility needs) and attendance at in-person and virtual conferences, χ 2 (df = 9, N = 493) = 14.6, P < .00001; α = .05). Respondents with ≥1 reported accessibility need were less likely to attend 1–2 in-person (70.8%) or virtual (50.9%) conferences per year compared with those without reported needs (78.6% and 63.7%, respectively; Fig. 2). Respondent s with ≥1 reported need were almost twice as likely (13.2%) to indicate they attended no in-person conferences per year compared with those without reported needs (6.0%); however, the trend was reversed for virtual conferences (Fig. 2). 
Management of accessibility needs
Of respondents who reported accessibility needs, 86 .6% reported using ≥1 compensatory strategy or tools (18.8% used 1; 67.8% used ≥2). Reported compensation strategies or tools are shown in Fig. 3. The most common compensation strategies reported  among all respondents were online access (online versions of presentations [43.4%] or downloadable slides [40.0%]) and reading slide text during an oral presentation (41.9%). Online access (downloadable  slides, electronic versions of posters or recorded talks) was a common solution across accessibility needs, especially those with verbal, visual, sensory, and processing needs. Reading slide text  during oral presentations was most common among respondents with verbal, processing, and hearing needs (Supplemental Table S3). Although 23.4% indicated  their needs do not require significant management, about half (47.5%) of these respondents also used ≥1 compensatory strategy or tool. Significantly, 17.7% indicated  that their accessibility needs are currently unmet (Fig. 3). Respondents with verbal needs were most likely  to report that their needs were not currently met (Supplemental Table S3). 
Accessibility of conference posters 
Respondents without reported accessibility needs were significantly more likely than respondents with reported accessibility needs to be aware of trends towards newer poster formats: 75.6% versus 63.5%, respectively (χ2 [df = 1, N = 413] = 6.8, P = .009). Respondents were asked to rate the importance of different parts of the poster on a scale of 1–5. All respondents regardless of reported accessibility needs consistently rated ‘Key findings’ as the most important aspect of a poster (mean, 4.71) and ‘Detailed methodology’ as least important (2.48; Supplemental Table S4). 
The survey presented respondents with images and descriptions of 4 different poster  layouts and asked to rate them on a scale of hard to gain information (1) to easy to gain information (5) (Supplemental Methods, Q10–13). Overall, respondents with and without reported needs (n=410) rated the #BetterPoster layout the most accessible (mean [95% confidence internal (CI)], 3.96 [3.86–4.07]), followed by infographic layout 1 (3.75 [3.65–3.86]), infographic layout 2 (3.69 [3.57–3.80]), and the traditional poster layout (2.89 [2.77–3.00]) as the least accessible (Figure 4a). A 1-way ANOVA evaluating the 4 layouts and mean accessibility was significant (α = .05; F3,1634 = 71.50; P < .0001). Post-hoc analysis indicated that the traditional layout was less accessible than all three other layouts (P < .001, each comparison; Bonferroni). The effect size was small for the #BetterPoster versus the two infographic layouts (d = .19 and .26, respectively, and large when compared to the traditional layout (d = 1.01).
Mean accessibility scores were significantly impacted by accessibility need status (with versus without) (α = .05; F1,1630 = 18.28; p < .0001) and poster format (α = .05; F3,1630 = 71.33; P < .0001), though the interaction of accessibility need status and format was not significant by 2-way ANOVA (α = .05; F3,1630 = 1.50; P = .317). Respondents without accessibility needs tended to view all layouts as more accessible than those with ≥1 reported accessibility need (Figure 4b). Respondents without reported needs rated the #BetterPoster layout and both infographic-style layouts (mean [95% CI]) similarly (4.04 [3.88–4.20], 3.94 [3.80–4.08], and 3.90 [3.74–3.77], respectively; Figure 4b). In contrast, respondents with ≥1 reported accessibility need were more likely to rate the #BetterPoster layout (3.91 [3.77–4.05]) higher than both of the infographic-style posters (3.61 [3.46–3.77] and 3.53 [3.36–3.70]), and significantly lower than respondents without reported accessibility needs (infographic 1, d = .34; infographic 2, d = .51; P < .05, both comparisons; Bonferroni; Figure 4b). The ratings of poster layout by accessibility need are presented in Supplemental Table S5. 
To analyze write-in comments and reduce the introduction of bias through manual analysis, we utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) to cluster related responses, surfacing the most salient themes. Based on the clustering of write-responses, the most commonly mentioned weakness of the traditional format was an overwhelming amount of text, especially in a busy poster hall where distractions may impair reading the detailed text. Strengths of the traditional poster were the familiarity of the format, knowing where to find pertinent information on the poster, and a viewer can still gain information without relying on spoken information. Correspondingly, respondents favored the reduced text of #BetterPoster and infographic layouts, but weaknesses included a lack of a clear reading order, presenting a conclusion without enough supporting data, and some important information may be lost. Respondents commented that and if too much information was not included, learning relied too much on auditory communication or scanning a QR code. 
While QR codes can link to accessibility features such as audio summaries, several respondents indicated that QR codes could be an accessibility barrier: not all phones can scan the QR codes, repeatedly task-switching between in-person and online content is challenging, and keeping track of several QR codes during the conference could be difficult. Several respondents also pointed to the need for readable font and colors. For example, “Font choice must be easily readable. Colors must be color-vision and contrast readable. The layout should be ordered so virtual slides in a screen reader read correctly, and color contrasts should be better. No amount of pretty graphics design will make your poster readable if you can't pick a font in a color that can be read.” 
Regardless of reported needs, less visual clutter was the most recommended improvement for posters among all respondents (70.7%; Fig. 5a). Bigger text and figures were commonly requested, as well as plain language. A summary of requests by accessibility need is presented in Supplemental Table S6. Audio summaries and videos were particularly favored by those with verbal (62.5% and 62.5%, respectively) and visual (44.4% and 47.6%) accessibility needs. Higher color contrast was requested by respondents who reported visual accessibility needs (42.9%), and also by respondents with verbal (37.5%) and hearing (36.4%) accessibility needs.  Respondents with visual needs were divided on fonts: 38.1% suggested serif fonts and the same percentage suggested sans-serif fonts. Sans-serif fonts were generally more favored by other respondents. Respondents reporting any accessibility need (7.7%), processing (10.4%), visual (9.5%), and sensory (8.7%) accessibility needs were significantly more likely than respondents without accessibility needs (0.6%) to request more text, χ2 (df = 4, N = 311) = 17.5, P < .0015; α = .05 (Supplemental Table S6). 
Accessibility of conference oral presentations
Similar to the trend for posters, 72.2% of respondents without reported accessibility needs were aware of the trend toward alternative formats for oral presentations (TED-style, and panel-style talks ) compared with 65.9% of respondents with reported accessibility needs, though relationship was not significant (χ2 [df = 1, N = 386] = 1.7, P = .186). Respondents were asked to rate the importance of different aspects of an oral presentation on a scale of 1–5. All respondents regardless of reported accessibility needs rated ‘Key findings’ as the most important aspect of an oral presentation (mean, 4.73) and ‘Detailed methodology’ (2.68) as least important (Supplemental Table S7). 
The survey presented respondents with descriptions of 3 different formats for oral presentations and asked to rate them on a scale of hard to gain information (1) to easy to gain information (5) (Supplemental Methods, Q18–20). Among all respondents with and without reported accessibility needs, the accessibility of the 3 presentations styles was significantly different by 1-way ANOVA (α = .05; F2,1138 = 35.72; P < .0001; Figure 6a). The traditional oral presentation (mean [CI], 3.51 [3.41–3.61]), with a combination of slides containing visuals and text, was significantly more accessible compared to TED-style (3.00 [2.89–3.13]; P < .05, Bonferroni; d = .49) and panel-style presentations (2.84 [2.73–2.96]; P < .05, Bonferroni; d = .65). 

Mean accessibility scores were significantly impacted by accessibility need status (with versus without) (α = .05; F1,1140 = 7.87; P = .0051) and presentation style (α = .05; F2,1140 = 35.85; P < .0001), though the interaction of accessibility need status and presentation style was not significant by 2-way ANOVA (α = .05; F2,1140 = 1.35; P = .2585). Respondents without reported accessibility needs tended to report all styles as more accessible than those with reported needs (Figure 6b). Respondents with reported accessibility needs rated the TED-style presentations (2.86 [2.70–3.03]) significantly lower than respondents without reported accessibility needs (3.20 [3.03–3.38]; P < .05, Bonferroni test; d = .30). A summary of oral presentation format scores by accessibility need is presented in Supplemental Table S8. 

Write-in responses were binned into clusters using NLP. The most common themes from the clusters were that traditional-style oral presentation benefited from a combination of auditory and visual information. Slides that included some written text improved accessibility; however, others commented too much text was detrimental. Respondents stated that TED-style and panel-style presentations were harder to follow if you missed some spoken words and that panel-style presentations would present challenges for sign language interpreters. Some respondents indicated that these newer-style oral presentations may be appropriate for delivering topline summaries, but not for presenting detailed data. Several respondents commented that TED-style and panel-style talks were heavily dependent on the charisma or skill of the presenter or moderator, and some could be perceived “hype but no substance” or manipulative. Some respondents found panel-style presentations engaging: “I really enjoy both being in and watching these. But they're usually for big picture things so they don't need detailed results and statistics.” However, other respondents indicated these presentations are a more frustrating experience: “There is often a body language component to these that I have to strain to understand. Usually, panelists will act in the role of experts. There is an unspoken language of head nods, lean backs, etc. I can miss the whole point of the discussion trying to understand how the panelists are actors in the show.” 
Invariably, asynchronous online access was the most requested accommodation across all respondents with and without accessibility needs (Supplemental Table S9). Among all respondents, 65.5% recommended making sides for oral presentations available in advance of the talk (Fig. 5b). Providing slides before the talk was most requested by those with reported visual (91.5%), verbal (86.7%), and mobility (85.7%) accessibility needs, and more than half (56.2%) of respondents without reported needs (Supplemental Table S9). A video recording made available after the presentation was most highly requested by those with reported processing (81.8%), mobility (78.6%), sensory (74.7%), and visual (74.6%) accessibility needs, and over half (53.3%) of those with no needs. Similar to the trend observed for more text on posters, only 1.8% of respondents without accessibility needs requested more text on slides versus 9.7% of respondents with ≥1 accessibility need. Live captions were most requested by respondents who reported verbal (66.7%), hearing (51.7%), and sensory (51.7%) accessibility needs (Supplemental Table S9).
Respondents urged that captions should be provided as standard practice and captions generated by stenography are preferable to auto-generated captions, as the captions need to be high quality. Inaccurate captions detract from accessibility17. As one respondent wrote, “NO auto-generated CRAPTIONS. ‘Almost’ accurate is no good. Something that looks like access but isn't access is worse, because now nobody feels bad about the lack of access. In fact, they're kind of proud of what they did. However, it is garbage and not actual access, and they're angry with my lack of appreciation.”
Accessibility of conference spaces
For conference spaces, respondents provided write-in responses recommending accommodations and improvements for accessibility that were analyzed and clustered using NLP (Figure 7). The most common themes to emerge revolved around providing more space between posters, improved seating (including seating in poster halls), online or print versions of slides and posters, captions and sign language interpreters, quiet spaces to rest, better acoustics (and reduce background noise), improved signage and mobility access, quality virtual options, more flexibility in viewing content digitally, larger high-resolution screens, longer times  between presentations, and health protections (Figure 7). 
Respondents recommended reduced crowding in poster halls and between rows of seating to improve mobility access, reduce sensory overstimulation and anxiety, and lower background noise to improve acoustics. Multiple respondents recommended reserved seating locations for those with low vision and mobility issues. Several comments made clear the need for seating in poster halls, for both viewers and for presenters with mobility or pain issues: “For the love of god have enough chairs, and let people sit down to look at posters.”  
Many comments focused providing less crowded quiet spaces to sit. Some suggested more quiet places for small discussions. Quiet seating spaces were requested for people with mobility and pain issues to rest and to give neurodivergent people a place for sensory relief. Many mentioned excessive noise or acoustics as a source of stress: “Pay more attention to acoustics! I can’t learn anything if I immediately get a migraine.”
Improved signage was requested by respondents with mobility issues: “I've often been forced to skip things because I was already in a lot of pain from walking so much. Keep walking areas clear for people with mobility aids to navigate safely. Have clearer signage so precious energy isn't spent on just trying to find locations.” 
Respondents also recommended more options for those with dietary restrictions, masking, and virtual options for those who cannot attend in-person due to health issues: “Lots of us disabled people still don’t feel safe in public spaces during covid. All conferences need a virtual/ hybrid track that isn’t second class.”
Conference instructions to authors
Instructions for presenters were sampled from 47 websites for conferences held in 2022 (Supplemental Table S1). More than half (55.3%) conferences did not include any instructions to presenters about how to design posters for accessibility. For conferences that did provide some guidance, there was a lot of variability. Though there was frequent mention of reducing text, only 14 conferences provided a minimum font size and just 5 included guidance for creating colorblind-friendly posters or suggested using “easily distinguishable” colors. Of the 14 conferences with some guidelines, only one set a minimum font size larger than 28 points . One conference stated text should be readable at a distance of 4 feet, two stated a distance of 3–5 feet, another readable at 10 feet, and one easily read “at a distance.” One conference, in addition to mentioning colorblindness (above) and having a minimum text size (above), mentioned that 10% of members had visual impairments, designing for dyslexia, and recommended a larger text than the stated minimum (40 points). 
Fewer conference guidelines provided any mention of providing accommodations for attendees or presenters. Of the 47 conferences sampled 3 provided childcare assistance and 1 mentioned mobility access. Quiet places, a chair on demand, or contact information to request accommodations were only mentioned by 2 conferences (each). 
Discussion 
Conference presentations and event spaces have often not been designed with accessibility  in mind 13,15,38. Here, we surveyed potential conference attendees with and without reported accessibility needs and queried their opinions on presentation formats, conference spaces, and recommendations to improve accessibility. We also sampled conference guidelines for mentions of accessibility. 
Broadly speaking, the traditional poster format was largely seen as less effective than the #BetterPoster or infographic layouts. The most common improvement suggested by respondents was to present less content, utilizing bigger font and images. The traditional oral presentation format was generally perceived as more accessible than alternative formats. The most common improvement suggested was to provide asynchronous online content. Conference spaces were noted for a lack of adequate seating, signage, and quiet spaces; poor acoustics; and overcrowded poster halls. 
Several respondents requested conferences provide better guidance for accessible presentations. However, most conference organizers provide no guidance to poster presenters about accessibility. Worse, some guidance was incompatible with accessibility (Supplemental Table S1). For example, the typical minimum text size was 24–28 points, but accessibility guidelines suggest text sizes of 60 to 100 points for text viewed under conditions similar to conference posters (e.g., about 2 meters away)39,40. Additionally, the Good Publication Practice guidelines, which provide recommendations for company-sponsored biomedical research (including manuscripts, meeting presentations, posters, and plain language summaries), do not include any guidelines for accessibility41.  
Respondents with reported accessibility needs tended to view all presentations as less accessible than respondents without accessibility needs (Fig. 4, 6). Respondents without reported accessibility needs tended to view the #BetterPoster and infographic layouts as similar; however, respondents with reported accessibility needs viewed the infographic layouts significantly lower (Fig. 4). A similar effect was observed with TED-style talks (Fig.6). Most respondents with ≥1 accessibility needs are already using compensatory strategies or tools to manage their accessibility needs and nearly 20% report their needs are still unmet (Figure 3, Supplemental Table S3). We suggest that while some changes in format may be perceived as small, not requiring much additional effort to adjust to for those without accessibility needs, these changes may have a larger impact for those with accessibility needs who may already be working hard to participate at conferences. However, survey respondents with accessibility needs were less likely to be aware of changes to presentation format, suggesting they may not be equal players in developing these newer formats. 
Conferences are often an essential aspect of an academic career1, and the accessibility of presentations and organization of conferences impacts a significant number of people. Based on a 2021 survey of American doctoral scientists, the percentage of scientists with reported disabilities is 11.4%42. In a survey of 6,000 American physicians, 3.1% identified as disabled43. These prevalences are lower than the 15% reported for the general population31. However, fewer academics or clinicians  may report disabilities than the general population, due to unawareness of potential accommodations, perceived stigma, or fear of discrimination44-46. It should also be noted that some neurodivergent individuals may not consider themselves as disabled47,48 and therefore may not be represented in the above surveys. Our respondents made it clear that equitable accessibility is not incorporated in the planning of many conferences. For example, respondents mentioned how exhausting it was to have to repeatedly ask for accommodations, such as closed captions. One responded mentioned how frustrating it was to be provided a sign language interpreter in a room that was too dark to watch them sign. One mentioned how the last conference they were at, the carpet was so plush, it was hard to push a wheelchair. Others commented on the lack of space to safely navigate in crowed rooms with mobility aids. Including more disabled, neurodivergent, or D/deaf people in the design of presentations and event planning could help address these issues to enable more of our colleagues to actively participate, learn, and collaborate at conferences15. 
Our data reinforce a basic principle of universal design: an accommodation made to help one demographic may benefit a much larger audience49. For example, captions were requested by a higher percentage of respondents with verbal accessibility needs (66.7%) than respondents who reported hearing accessibility needs (51.7%; Supplemental Table S9). This is consistent  with other reports that captions benefit hearing adults and non-native speakers  17,50. Additionally, the use of higher color contrast may improve accessibility for people with reported visual needs, but it was also requested by those with reported verbal, hearing, and mobility accessibility needs (Supplemental Table S6). These findings are in line with studies that demonstrate less reliance on color to communicate meaning can improve accessibility and reduce cognitive load for a broad population51,52. Using an accessible color palette is not a costly accommodation: there are several free online tools available to check the level of color contrast and accessibility of colors for colorblind viewers or generate accessible color palettes (Supplemental Table S10). 
One of the most commonly requested accommodations was virtual access, which can help meet a variety of needs. Online access allows for posting slides in advance of talks, large-print versions of presentations, transcripts, and videos. Online access also expands reach to people who can’t be there in person due to  health, financial, or logistical issues1. Other studies have also reported that virtual access is a valuable addition to conferences and can improve accessibility and inclusion1,53, though there is still room for improvement54. QR codes are an opportunity to provide accessible online features, but further discussion is warranted on how they may be best implemented. Including a text URL may be helpful for people who may not be able to scan the code.
The universal design principles also apply in conference spaces. Respondents with sensory and hearing accessibility needs both recommended improved acoustics to provide relief from sensory overload and to make it easier to hear conversations. Respondents with mobility needs and/or chronic pain and those with sensory accessibility needs requested quiet places they could sit and take a break. Both respondents with mobility and visual accessibility needs requested better signage. Several groups of respondents recommended more space between posters to reduce background noise for easier conversations, prevent sensory overload, provide necessary space for mobility aids or service animals, and make space for seating at posters. Seating in poster halls was requested by people viewing posters and by some who had issues presenting their own posters because they couldn’t stand for the entire poster session. 
We targeted our online survey to academic, medical, D/deaf, neurodivergent, and disabled communities. Though a majority of respondents did report accessibility needs, we did not see an even distribution of respondents across all targeted demographics. For example, response was higher in the academic community than the medical community. The CDC reports that the highest prevalence of disabilities is mobility-related disabilities (11.1%), followed closely by cognition (10.9%), hearing (5.7%), and then vision (4.9%) 55. However, in our study population we saw the highest participation from people with sensory and processing needs, followed by hearing and visual accessibility needs, and then mobility. To ensure privacy, we did not gather identifiable information on the location of our respondents, although this does mean we cannot study regional preferences. While we focused primarily on accessibility and accommodations for receiving information at conferences, it is also essential that all attendees can present and communicate their own research, and network. Future study of accommodations that enable presenting, networking, and conversing with diverse groups of people in a larger and more diverse sample size, are warranted. [Other limitations to include?]
Science benefits from diversity56,57, yet inaccessibility is costing us the diverse voices of our D/deaf, hard-of-hearing, disabled, and neurodivergent colleagues18. If a person in a wheelchair can’t access a building, the fault lies in the building, not the person; we need to improve the building . Likewise, if a person can’t participate at a conference, we need to improve accessibility at the conference. Through increased online access and utilization of basic universal design principals, everyone can take steps to make conferences more inclusive and equitable.

Methods
Survey and data collection
Potential conference attendees were queried regarding their experiences from academic conferences. As neurodivergent and D/deaf or hard-of-hearing participants may not identify as disabled, and some disabilities may impact multiple aspects of attending a conference, we surveyed respondents on categories of accessibility needs (hearing, processing, mobility, sensory, verbal, and visual), not specific disabilities or conditions. Respondents reported their accessibility needs and management strategies, evaluations of presentation formats (numerical scale: 1-hard; 5-easy to gain information), and recommended improvements they would like to see implemented to enhance accessibility and information delivery. The survey questions are reported in the Supplemental Methods. Survey response data is provided in the Data Supplement. The survey design was reviewed by the Compliance and Ethics committee at IPG Health Medical Communications. Responses were collected anonymously using the polling website SurveyMonkey (https://www.surveymonkey.com). Respondents were informed on the survey’s first page that their responses would be treated as confidential and not be used to identify them, that survey data may be published in posters, manuscripts, or videos. There was no monetary incentive offered for completing the survey. The 23- question survey was distributed (16 August–7 September 2022) via social media platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) and targeted to both a more general audience (including #AcademicTwitter and #MedTwitter) and to disability and accessibility groups (including #ActuallyAutistic, @AskADHD, #Disability, #DisabilityInclusion, #DisabledinSTEM, #DigitalAccessibility, #DocsWithDisabilities, #Dyslexia, #Dyspraxia, #Hyperlexia, #Irlen, #NEISvoid, #OCD, #Synesthesia, #UXDesign, #Neurodiversity,  #UXDesign). Survey questions were of varied format and included questions with predefined answer choices, free-response options, binary (yes/no) answers, and 5-point Likert-style choices. We reached out to larger organizations from the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada to reach a broad demographic including (but not limited) to universities and medical centers at diverse locations, the Healthcare Communications Association, the Society for Health Communication, firstmedcoms jobs.com, IPG Health Medical Communications, Cochrane, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, The Australian Society for Microbiology, and Northeastern Microbiologists: Physiology, Ecology, and Taxonomy, and Meeting Professionals International. 
We examined conference websites in September 2022 for instructions provided to presenters. Websites were selected arbitrarily and included in the dataset if they provided instructions for both oral presentations and poster presentations, and the poster presentation instructions specified a maximum size. We looked at whether instructions mentioned (1) colorblind audience members and (2) a minimum or recommended font size, which is relevant to people with low vision. We also examined the text for any other mentions of accessibility issues. A full list of the conference websites is listed in Supplemental Table S1.
Formats and styles of presentation
In our survey, we defined the traditional poster format to have the following common design elements: a large headline banner, most content is text based (600 – 1,000 words), generally organized into columns, grouped by subheadings, text is generally not embedded in figures, and they may or may not include QR codes. There is usually high contrast between the text and the background. The #BetterPoster layout was described as having a large central space for conclusions and main findings written in plain language, and sidebars for the title, background, methods, and additional tables/figures. Content is less text based (<500 words), and typically includes larger font and more white space. Additional details are often provided with a QR code. Emphasis may be added using bold or colour for important concepts. There is usually high contrast between the text and the background. Text may or may not be embedded in figures. Infographic layout 1 was described as prominently featuring the conclusions and main findings in plain language and combined illustrative figures with embedded text. Large graphic icons and more colours may be used for emphasis. The flow is often highlighted with icons or visual elements. Content is less text based (<500 words), and typically includes larger font and more white space. Additional details are often provided with a QR code. There is typically decent contrast between text and background. Infographic layout 2 was described as prominently featuring the conclusions and main findings in plain language and combined illustrative figures with embedded text. Large graphic icons and more visual elements may be used for emphasis. Visual elements and icons are often colourful. The flow is often less linear and more visual. Content is less text based (<500 words), and typically includes more white space. Additional details are often provided with a QR code. Pictures showing each style are available in the survey, presented in the Supplemental Methods.
In the survey, a traditional oral presentation was described as potentially containing several slides (8 to 12 slides per 10 minutes). The slides often contain a combination of text and images. Some of the slides may contain only text. TED-style talks were described as containing few to no slides or slides with little to no text). Panel-style talks were described as an interview or discussion between a small number of people, containing no slides. 
Literature Review
We performed a literature review to identify other studies and surveys on conference accessibility. To find enough articles of relevance we carried out searches on three different platforms.  Our first PubMed strategy combined various terms for accessibility, conferences, presentation types, respondents, and surveys. Where appropriate mesh terms were available these were also used. To increase the number of relevant hits, our second PubMed search limited any free text terms to being within the title fields but combined fewer topics at a time (accessibility + conferences + presentation types; accessibility + conferences + surveys; accessibility + conferences + respondents; accessibility + presentation types + surveys; accessibility + presentation types + respondents). We further searched all the available databases within Dialog. With the coverage of databases such as Embase, this would also capture conference abstracts. Here we limited the accessibility and presentation type terms to the titles of the articles; however, terms for conferences, respondents and surveys were searched in title or abstract text. Finally, general Googling was conducted using various iterations of our terms.
Statistical analysis
Responses to questions with predefined answer choices were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Data from Likert-scale questions was interpreted as ordinal  to determine the mean and significance was assessed by ANOVA, α=0.05 58. For post-hoc comparisons, the Bonferroni correction to adjust for Type-1 error. To determine the relationships between accessibility needs and conference attendance and accessibility needs and awareness of alternative presentation formats, we used chi-squared tests of independence. Effect size was determined using Cohen’s d.
To determine the relationship between accessibility needs and management strategies, we calculated Phi correlations for each need-strategy pair. Phi correlations are designed to assess the relationship between binary variables, which was the case with this data (needs and strategies were both yes/no responses). A threshold of 0.30 or greater was used to indicate a moderate relationship. A χ2 square test was not used because both the variables were binary, and respondents could belong to multiple groups. 
Analysis of write-in responses
In order to find trends in free response write-in comments, while also attempting to reduce bias that could be introduced through manual analysis, we utilized methods from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to cluster the responses semantically, so similar responses would be grouped together, surfacing the most salient themes from the responses. For this process, we first split the response into individual sentences using the python NLTK library because many responses contained several distinct thoughts or ideas. Then, we utilized a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to convert each sentence into a semantic representation that we could use for clustering. The representations generated by these models are high-dimensional dense vectors. Importantly, LLMs create contextualized representations of text; the representation for any given word in the text is entirely dependent on the words that appear with it locally, which creates a much richer semantic representation of the text as a whole. Sentences that are closer in meaning are physically closer in the high-dimensional space.   
We specifically chose to use a sentence-BERT to calculate accurate semantic similarity between sentences, as measured by the cosine similarity (between -1 and 1, 1 indicating that the vectors are the same) and employed the pretrained all-MiniLM-L6-v2 SBERT model from the SentenceTransformers python framework, accessed through the HuggingFace model hub, to map the input text to 384-dimensional dense vectors, which we then used in our approach.
For each question, we clustered the vectors of the response sentences using Agglomerative Clustering, which begins with every vector being its own cluster, then recursively merges clusters to the cluster which is closest.  Distance between the vectors was determined using cosine similarity [0, 2], where a distance of 0 means that the vectors are collocated. The distance between clusters was calculated as the maximum distance between any two vectors in the two clusters. Clusters were merged until no clusters were within a distance threshold of 0.8.
We ranked the resulting clusters by their cohesiveness, i.e., the average of all the pairwise cosine similarities for the points in the cluster.  Clusters with a single point were given a cohesiveness of 0.0.  A cohesiveness cutoff of 0.467 was determined by manual review. Clusters with a cohesiveness below the cutoff were excluded.
For question 23 in particular, due to its very open-ended nature, we additionally visualized the response sentences to see the trends not just within clusters but also between them.  For this we again use the 384-dimensional S-BERT vectors for each sentence, but since visualizing points in such a high-dimensional space is impossible, we applied nonlinear dimensionality reduction to map the high-dimensional space to a two-dimensional one.  We chose T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE), as it tends to distribute points into groups or clumps more than other methods, to convert the high-dimensional similarity between points into a probability distribution where the distance between two points in the original space is proportional to their joint probabilities under the new distribution. Then an unsupervised mapping is learned between the high dimensional space and a new two-dimensional space that best preserves the same probability between any two given points, as measured using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We use the tSNE implementation in the scikit learn python library. The result of tSNE is shown in Figure 7. Additional details and code for analysis is provided in the Supplemental Methods.

Analysis of write-in responses
In order to find trends in free response write-in comments, while also attempting to reduce bias that could be introduced through manual analysis, we utilized methods from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to cluster the responses semantically, so similar responses would be grouped together, surfacing the most salient themes from the responses. For this process, we first split the response into individual sentences using the python NLTK library (Bird, Steven, Edward Loper and Ewan Klein (2009).  Natural Language Processing with Python.  O'Reilly Media Inc.) because many responses contained several distinct thoughts or ideas. Then, we utilized a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to convert each sentence into a semantic representation that we could use for clustering. The representations generated by these models are high-dimensional dense vectors.  Importantly, LLMs create contextualized representations of text; the representation for any given word in the text is entirely dependent on the words that appear with it locally, which creates a much richer semantic representation of the text as a whole. While the values of any given dimension in these vectors are uninterpretable, the overall position of the vectors in the high-dimensional semantic space is representative of their meaning, and sentences that are closer in meaning are physically closer in the high-dimensional space.   
We specifically chose to use a sentence-BERT (SBERT, also commonly referred to as a sentence-transformer) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084.pdf) model, as SBERT models are specifically optimized to calculate accurate semantic similarity between sentences, as measured by the cosine similarity of the angle between them: 
Where X and Y are the vectors, XY is their dot product, and ||X|| is the length of X and ||Y|| is the length of Y.  Cosine similarity ranges between [-1, 1], with 1 indicating that the vectors are the same.
We employed the pretrained all-MiniLM-L6-v2 SBERT model from the SentenceTransformers python framework, accessed through the HuggingFace model hub. This model, which was trained on over 1 billion data points, was selected for its combination of excellent performance on related benchmarks with computational efficiency (it has far fewer internal parameters and can be easily used even without access to a GPU).  This particular model maps input text to 384-dimensional dense vectors, which we then used in our approach.
For each question, we clustered the vectors of the response sentences using Agglomerative Clustering, which begins with every vector being its own cluster, then recursively merges clusters to the cluster which is closest.  As the vectors are by definition intended to be compared using cosine similarity, we used the corresponding cosine distance metric:
Since cosine similarity ranges from [-1, 1], that means that cosine distance ranges between [0, 2], where a distance of 0 means that the vectors are collocated. The distance between clusters was calculated as the maximum distance between any two vectors in the two clusters.  While there are many other ways to define “distance” between clusters, e.g., average distance, minimum, we found this definition to yield higher quality clusters.  We continued clustering, or merging clusters, until no clusters were within a distance threshold of 0.8 to each other.  This threshold was chosen by manually examining the clustering results for responses to one question during early development.  
We ranked the resulting clusters by their cohesiveness, i.e., the average of all the pairwise cosine similarities for the points in the cluster.  Clusters with a single point were given a cohesiveness of 0.0.  A cohesiveness cutoff of 0.467 was determined by manual review. Clusters with a cohesiveness below the cutoff were excluded.
For question 23 in particular, due to its very open-ended nature, we additionally visualized the response sentences to see the trends not just within clusters but also between them.  For this we again use the 384-dimensional S-BERT vectors for each sentence, but since visualizing points in such a high-dimensional space is impossible, we applied nonlinear dimensionality reduction to map the high-dimensional space to a two-dimensional one.  We chose T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) (https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf) as it tends to distribute points into groups or clumps more than other methods, which can tend to show all points together in the center of the space. The tSNE algorithm first converts the high-dimensional similarity between points into a probability distribution where the distance between two points in the original space is proportional to their joint probabilities under the new distribution. Then an unsupervised mapping is learned between the high dimensional space and a new two-dimensional space that best preserves the same probability between any two given points, as measured using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback S, Leibler RA (1951) On information and sufficiency. Ann Math Stat 22:79–86). We use the tSNE implementation in the scikit learn python library. The result of tSNE is shown in Figure X.  Points which appeared in the same cluster are shown in the same color.
